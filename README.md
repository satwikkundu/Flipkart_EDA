# Flipkart_EDA
This EDA initiative investigates Flipkart's 2014-2018 sales history to reveal product, channel, and regional revenue and profit drivers. It detects seasonal patterns, outliers, and budgetary performance through the use of histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation. The findings inform price, promotions, and market expansion strategies.
